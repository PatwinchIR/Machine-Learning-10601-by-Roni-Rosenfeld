1. exampleA.txt, exampleB.txt and exampleA4.txt are provided as examples of the expected format of the output.
Neither the specific numerical values nor their relative difference has any significance or relevance to the correct solution.
These numbers are provided to show the expected output format in terms of the number of lines and number of output values per line.
exampleA.txt assumes 14 instances in the test dataset and exampleB.txt assumes 5 as the size of the version space and 4 data points in the test data set. These values are different in your problem and your output should be formatted accordingly. 

2. Create partA.{py|java|c|cpp} and partB.{py|java|c|cpp} to put your implementations. These two files should have the same extension (i.e. programming language).
