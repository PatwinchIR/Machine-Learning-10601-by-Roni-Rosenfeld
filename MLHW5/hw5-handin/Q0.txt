1.Do you think a decision tree will work for the politician dataset?
Yes, because the instances in politician dataset are represented in attribute-value pairs,
and the target function "party" is a binary outcome, which means a discrete value. Those 2 characteristics
makes it sufficient for decision tree learning.

2.What about for the education dataset?
Still, same as the politician dataset, the education dataset has two important characteristics,
instances are represented in attr-val pairs, and has discrete outcome.

In both cases, in the real world, there might be some situation that values of some attributes are
missing or have noise, decision tree can deal with those two kinds of circumstances. Thus, I think
a decision tree learning will work for both the politician and education datasets.
